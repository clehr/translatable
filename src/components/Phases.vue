            even helpful because it helps you understanding the structure of the language you want to learn better.

            <b>3. Passive hearing:</b>Hear the text several times while doing something else like cleaning watching TV,
                etc.

        <vs-row class="margin-bottom" vs-justify="center">
            <b>4. Speak:</b> Hear the text in the foreign language and speak along with it or pause after every sentence to
                repeat it.
