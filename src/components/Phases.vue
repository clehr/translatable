            <h3>1. Translate:</h3>
            Decode your text word for word. It doesn't matter if the translation sounds weird. It is even helpful
            because it
            helps you understanding the structure of the language you want to learn better.

            <h3>2. Active hearing:</h3>
            Read your translation as you hear the text in the foreign language.

        <div class="margin-bottom">
            <h3>3. Passive hearing:</h3>
            Hear the text several times while doing something else like cleaning watching TV, etc.
        </div>

        <div class="margin-bottom">
            <h3>4. Speak:</h3>
            Hear the text in the foreign language and speak along with it or pause after every sentence to repeat it.
